# 3D-rotation-demo

This 3D Rotation Webtool was created for the UCSD MAE30A Remote Teaching. I was an instructional assistant in the class in Winter 2021 quarter.

My contributions:
- Developed a 3D rotation web visualization tools based on Three.js to help the remote teaching
- Built an interactive panel to control 3D rotations of the object around three axes of its local coordinate system
- Recorded a video to answer the question "Are 3D rotations commutative?" 

The video was posted on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df8ezbdTC6o
